Now, here is his debut album of sexy, hip hop soul with a jazz-funk twist.\n\nDrummer, keyboardist, musician… Tomachi aka Tom Atkinson is nothing if not all three of these things...\n\nHis debut solo album 'The Hotel Vermont Sessions' is the culmination of several years worth of pent-up musical drive, held in check while he's played in a variety of bands such as SJD, One Million Dollars, Breaks Co-Op, Dam Native, Foghorn, The Roughness, Jungle Fungus and more. If you've not seen the man play you've certainly heard him!\n\nObviously it's the SJD and One Million Dollars projects where Tomachi has most made his mark in the last few years, but it was a long, slow process with both of them. One that eventually led to the creation of this album.\n\nFighting an ever-increasing sense of frustration as both of these projects took more than a year each to complete, Tomachi began working on musical ideas of his own, ones not limited by the confines of a drum riser.\n\nDescribing his sound as sexy, hip hop soul with a jazz-funk twist, Tomachi has also brought in a rollcall of friends to help, including longtime friends and collaborators Dam Native on lead single 'Mic Is Mine' as well as the likes of King Kapisi, Godfrey de Grut [Loungehead/Brooke Fraser band], Nick Atkinson and Tim Stewart [ex-Supergroove], Kingsley Melhuish, Nigel Gavin, Hamish Clarke [Breaks Co-Op], John Highstead [Relax-o-matic] and many, many more.\n\nTracks:\n\nIntro\n100 Beats\nNecessity\nStay This Way Forever\nHot Laksa\nMic Is Mine\nBeeboo\nWhere I'm At\nFlight Of The Yellow Flamingo\nEOG\nSelby Song\nSteak Sandwich\nPercussion Song\nTurn The Lights On\nTurn The Lights On\n92 BPM Improvised\nChunky Muma\nTasty Omelette\nSonorous Citizen\n\nPurchasing more than one item?
